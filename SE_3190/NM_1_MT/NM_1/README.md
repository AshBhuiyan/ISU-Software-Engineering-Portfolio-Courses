## NM_1 Midterm Project: ISU Campus Explorer



### Overview

ISU Campus Explorer is a web-based catalog that showcases buildings at Iowa State University.
The goal of the project is to help users visually explore key locations on campus — such as Parks Library and Carver Hall — through an interactive catalog of pages.
Each “product” in our catalog represents a campus building, complete with images, descriptions, and navigation links that connect to related pages (map, FAQ, authors, etc.).

Mekhi focused on the overall design and user experience of the project. He created the landing page and the Parks Library page, ensuring the site had a clean, consistent layout and modern styling. He also customized the shared theme and worked on visual details such as navigation, image galleries, and the video integration for Parks Library to make the site feel polished and user-friendly.

Ash worked on the functionality and interactivity of the site. He built the Campus Map and Carver Hall pages, connecting them through clickable navigation and dynamic data from the JSON file. He also developed the FAQ page using JavaScript to load all questions and answers automatically, helping make the project more dynamic and efficient.
