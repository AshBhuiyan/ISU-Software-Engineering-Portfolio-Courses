Activity 06.

## What this is
Small React app scaffolded with Vite. Components pass props; layout uses simple flexbox.

## Run locally
1. Rename the folder to **NETID_Activity06**.
2. From the project root:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open the shown local URL in your browser.

## Notes
- `UserCards.jsx` imports Bootstrap and uses React-Bootstrap's `Card` component.
- `App.jsx` renders two `<UserCard />` components with props and arranges them side-by-side with `display: flex` (challenge complete).
