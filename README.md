# ISU Software Engineering Portfolio Courses
# Web & UI/UX Portfolio – Ash Bhuiyan

Hi, I’m Ash – a Software Engineering major with a Data Science minor at Iowa State University.  
I’m particularly interested in front-end development, UI/UX design, and creating accessible interfaces that are clear and intuitive for real users.

This portfolio highlights two core courses and projects:

- **COM S 3190 – Web Development** (front-end web applications)
- **COM S 3090 – Software Development** (Android/mobile front-end)

In these courses, I served as the **front-end developer** on my team and was recognized as the **Best UI/UX Designer** for my work on layout, visual design, and user experience.

## COM S 3090 – Software Development

**Role:** Front-End / UI Developer for Android Application  
**Focus:** Mobile app UI design, usability, and user flows

### Android App Project – Multi-Screen Mobile Application

- Served as the **front-end/UI developer** for a team Android app project.
- Designed the overall **navigation flow** between screens:
  - Clear entry points for the main user tasks
  - Simple, logical paths to complete actions without confusion
- Implemented layouts that follow common mobile design patterns:
  - Consistent headers, buttons, and spacing across screens
  - Intuitive placement of interactive elements to reduce user friction
- Focused heavily on **readability and accessibility**:
  - Chose font sizes and contrast that are comfortable on mobile
  - Kept screens uncluttered, with one main action per view where possible
- Collaborated closely with teammates:
  - Provided mockups and UI sketches before implementation
  - Adjusted the design based on feedback and user testing within the class

**Outcome:**  
> The app’s interface and user experience were praised for being intuitive and visually consistent, and I was recognized as the **Best UI/UX Designer** in the course for my front-end work.

## How This Relates to the Student Web Designer Role

The Student Web Designer position in the Office of Student Financial Aid focuses on:

- Updating and improving **WordPress** websites  
- Making **HTML-level** adjustments for structure and accessibility  
- Testing pages with accessibility tools and documenting improvements  

Through COM S 3190 and COM S 3090, I’ve:

- Built front-end interfaces from scratch with a strong focus on **UI/UX**  
- Used **semantic HTML** and thoughtful layout to make pages more usable  
- Practiced designing with **accessibility and clarity** in mind  
- Taken the lead on front-end decisions in team projects  

I’m excited to apply these skills to real ISU websites and learn even more about accessibility standards and inclusive web design.
